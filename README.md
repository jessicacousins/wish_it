# Thought Garden

## Description

This is an interactive web experience that lets users "plant" flowers by typing thoughts or wishes into a text input. Each submitted thought blossoms into a animated flower on a full-screen canvas, surrounded by floating fireflies, fluttering butterflies, and a dynamic sky that can toggle between day and night.
